How do I feel? **My best!**

> I'm doing what I want, building SaaS in MY OWN company at [DaSkrad](https://daskrad.com).
> Travelling when I want, where I want to

Writing this from Luxembourg where I came to meet my sister's
family and attend my nephew's birthday

At the end of last month, I was laid off from my then company.
I _should've felt sad but it didn't_. I was and am more excited
working on DaSkrad

Talking about DaSkrad, [Orshot](https://orshot.com) which is the project I'm working
on right now, has picked up a tiny bit and has 4 customers
at the time of writing this. Small validation in a big market.
I'll keep going

I remember when I got my first paid users on [Pika](https://pika.style),
it felt like impossible happening, like WOW!
It unlocked a side of me I didn't even know I had

It's exciting even now with Orshot, but not that much

But I'm just happy, and grateful that I'm getting to work
on my own ideas and show the world a bit of my world :)

I'm in general, excited about life. I'm tied more towards my goals
than anything, intentionally. It wakes me up, makes me check databases,
analytics, logs, and what not

**I wouldn't say life is right on track, is it ever?**
Yet I'm in sukoon. I guess that's good enough.
Learnt it a hard way to let go of what you can't control,
and life has been peaceful

Happy and grateful for everything! Friends keep up
and make life a lot better and help me be sane.
Way of living have been light, focus on bigger things

```
I would dance on the songs I sing
I'll fly with my tiny wings in the sky so high
And when I can, I'll take everyone with me to fly
I'll sit on trees, make friends with them
I'll bring them stories, and some peace to stem
I'll then fly again, for new stories to unfold
To live them again, some days hot, some nights cold
```
