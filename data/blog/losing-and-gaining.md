![Rishi at Oceanografic in Valencia](/images/posts/rishi-valencia-oceanograpfic.jpg)

I just got back home today after a good
10 days trip exploring Alicante and Valencia in Spain.
It was my by far one of the most exciting,
adventurous and memorable trip

In Alicante, I was at beach where someone stole my iPhone, Airpods
and all the cash from my wallet. I kept my bag at the shore while
I went to swim for good 1 hour or more. Came back and checked the bag,
things were pffed

Later that day I found myself walking towards
the thief with my 3 new morrocon friends who
helped me with mobile data so I could track stolen phone's location
with my other(backup) phone, which was also in my bag and
which the thief didn't steal

Post that I went to police to report the incident,
to which they just said they'll try. And then made 3 new friends
in the police station one of whom also got their phone stolen.
After talking about the incident they wanted to help me
go to the last live location of my stolen phone and beat the thief
and get my phone back

It was quite a plan, we went there and only found residential buildings.
It would be quite impossible to find my phone there, so we gave up

That day ended at 2:30ish in the night.
I remember laughing while walking back my Airbnb in the night

In Valencia I was most excited about Tomatina,
that's also why I went there. Although it was too crowded in Tomatina,
I was really enjoying, dancing and singing with some
groups that I met there. While at it and throwing tomatoes,
I also launched my silver ring I was wearing in the crowd.
My father gave me that ring the last time I went to India in Jan

What didn't suprise me was I wasn't surprised or sad after losing stuff.
I guess I would've been in panic mode if it was about a person

**I gained a way of living** that I've been practicing more so recently.
It's **a life that doesn't expect, depend or thinks of what others think**.
That has always been an ideal way of living for me,
but in real it's really hard to practice

I've gained some steps towards that, and I'm enjoying the journey

ye dukh alag hai ki usse main duur ho rahaa hun
ye gam juda hai vo khud mujhe dur kar raha hai,

tere bichadne par likh raha hun main taza gazlen
ye tera gham hai jo mujhko mashoor kar raha hai
