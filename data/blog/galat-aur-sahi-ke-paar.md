excerpt: I believe freedom brings you closer to what you're meant to. When you're not bounded with the gazillion expectations of this world, you start to respect things beyond.

"_Ik kudi jidda naam mohabbat, gum hai_" is playing.
It's 2:01 am in Berlin

Life has been a "do whatever you don't feel like" lately.
The last time I did this, it was rewarding

Often I think about why I'm doing what I'm doing.
Why am I prioritizing some things over other?
Why anyone does that?

The answer to it always ends up with one word for me.
**And that is, freedom**

I believe freedom brings you closer to what you're meant to.
When you're not bounded with the gazillion expectations of this world,
you start to respect things beyond.
Things that go on in your mind, your heart,
your thoughts, the ones that you wouldn't share with anyone
because they can't comprehend it

And I guess that's how you create a world, of your own,
bigger than the one you live in. It all comes with freedom

```
pata hai, yahan se bohot duur
galat aur sahi ke paar
ek maidan hai
me wahan milunga tujhe
```
