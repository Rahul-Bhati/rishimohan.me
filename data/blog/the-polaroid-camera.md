![The Polaroid Camera in Memory Book - Rishi Mohan](/images/posts/the-gift.jpg)

I don't really like gifts. Specially expensive ones

While I was in India in January, 2025,
**I received a Polaroid Camera as a gift**.
And not just that, there was a case,
and extra set of films with the camera

And while I always wanted to get a Polaroid camera,
and that I loved it. I liked more the parcel.
It was sent manually through a courier

There was **a courier receipt** on the parcel.
With the name of the sender.
There were other fields too,
but all of them were empty

My eyes hovered on a field at the bottom of the receipt.
It said "_Reciever's name and relationship_"

On the other side of parcel, there was **a plain paper**.
It had my name, address and phone number written in handwriting

Both the paper, and the receipt were pasted
on the package with cellophane tape.
I really really wanted to keep both of these with me,
intact. And so I carefully cut both of these out
and managed to put these in my diary

I'm a sucker for handwritten things.
They're more valuable to me than most gifts.
Even if has nothing meaningful written,
the fact that it's personal makes it more nostalgic to me

Yesterday, I put the paper, the receipt in my Memory book

There's also the **first photo** that I printed using the
Polaroid camera

> Two cups of chai :)

I'm also waiting for a photo, eagerly.
**There's a condition onto it**

It'll be when stars will align,
when there'll be moments,
when there'll be light.
When it'll be all real

I hope that happens soon,
and I hope that happens every day

And that it's captured and printed,
with **the Polaroid Camera**
