![Living the good past - Rishi Mohan](/images/posts/flying-kites-with-kids.jpg)

Yesterday, it was Makar Sankranti in India.
It's a festival in which we fly kites

I had a flight back home to Agra from Goa yesterday.
I arrived at Home in the afternoon.
I also had calls and work to do
and got free only in the evening

Kids from colony came to me with their kites
and manjha and asked if we can fly kite together.
We used to fly kites together in this season
before I moved to Berlin

Most of the kids in the colony don't know
how to fly kites, they're mostly in the age range of 10 to 20

So we went to my roof and flew one kite.
The kids got so excited they were jumping and laughing
and singing random funny songs.
It made me happy too, but what made me smile
was how it reminded me of when I was kid and used to fly kites
with some of my friends(Manish, Gaurav, Tushar if you ever read this)

We flew the kite until it was almost night.
The kids were all happy flying kites themselves
and seeing it fly so high

They were like "_bhiya, chand tak pohoncha do patang ko_" and
"_bhiya, sabki patang kaat do_" ðŸ˜‚

That was yesterday. They came today again. And we flew again

It's small moments like these that makes the kid inside me happy.
I want to be able to **do more such things
which I loved doing as a kid**

To keeping the kid inside us alive and free!
