excerpt: Reflecting on my time at Borg on my last day working here

_Do you know what a bit of passion can do to you?_

It can help you land a new role.
Or it can help you relocate to your
dream place. And if you're a bit lucky(like me),
then you might get both :)

You see this ^ Twitter DM?

It's from [Maciek](https://x.com/macieklaskus), the founder of Borg.
I recieved this DM on Dec 04, 2021 in which
he's appreciating my side-project [Kizie](/projects/kizie),
which I was passionaltely working on at that time

We talked a bit and he suggested me
to apply for a role at Borg.
The team was building [Hive](https://hive.one) and I loved the idea,
it got me excited. And so I applied

Fast forward to couple of months,
I was offered the role at Borg.
And not just that, I wanted to relocate to
Berlin and Borg helped me with that.
It was a huge thing for me because
along with working with a great, encourgaing team,
I was also getting to live in the EU,
get exposed to new cultures, EU startup scene
and travel to places I always dreamed of

**Never in my life I imagined** building a side-project
would lead me to a life I'm living right now.
It was like dreams come true for me.
And I feel when I'll look back and connect the dots,
the opportunity would probably be an important event
of my life

### Today is my last day at Borg

I had a great experience working with
Maciek, Danish, Valery, Thomas in these last couple of years

Every one of them is really good at what they do and
makes up a great team. Extremely grateful
to have worked with the team

I've learned a lot in these years,
specially about entrepreneurship(thanks Maciek),
taking balanced decisions(thanks Danish),
design perfectionism(thanks Valery),
importance of having a great backend engineer by your side ðŸ˜…(thanks Thomas)

And while I'm at it, thanks to Dirk(Head of Operations at Borg)
for helping me with all the paperwork related to relocation, work and more

I feel more **empowered**, **confident** and **clear** about building now.
And that's what this opportunity has given me

The whole of team hasn't met much, and we mostly
worked remotely. Said that, I've this picture of us
from our last meet :)

### What's next?

I'm going to continue my work on my side-projects as always.
Also, I plan to launch [Orshot](https://orshot.com) soon

More things are brewing up as I write this
