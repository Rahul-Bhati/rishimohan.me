excerpt: A random chat of a person playing happy birthday on Ukulele, a beautiful soul singing a song because they were remembering me at that moment, funny moment videos with a good friend, cringe photos I took of a friend on a trip

While installing iOS 26 just now, I was clearing up space on my iPhone

I opened WhatsApp's storage settings and ended up spending
good time on the Manage storage screen where it shows
media from all your chats

Until now, I used to think Google Photo's memory highlights
was the most nostalgic feature. But after seeing my WhatsApp's
Chat Storage screen, my mind has changed

It has **voice notes, photos, videos etc. from over 10 years back** or even more,
from people who I don't talk to or know anymore

I think I appreciated all of it less in those moments,
I appreciate it more now

**In minutes, I travelled years**

The memories which were blurred a bit by the last few years and the present,
have come back sharper on that one screen

Voice notes that I listened to again and again,
photos and videos that made me want to relive some moments,
some poetry that I recited dramatically

All of it told me only one thing which I'm very grateful for

**I was, I am and I will be loved**
