![What we shouldn't, why we still do? â€“ Rishi Mohan](/images/posts/why-we-do-we-shouldnt.jpg)

Why do you do some things,
even when you know you shouldn't?

What drives that decision?

The song "_Tere hawale_" was playing on the TV.
I picked up **a book**. There was **a card** inside it,
**some words** written all over it which
strangely, didn't make sense.
I remember smiling the last time I read this same card

Not this time though. The writing was in English.
It **missed meaning**. Lines were phrased wrong,
the doodling mismatched, the emotions vapoured,
leaving behind words, **dry, cold words**

Then I read **some emails** from some time back,
and now all of these questions are running in my mind

Why we intentionally do things which we know
isn't right for us?

Imagine how strong the driving force could be,
which makes you do things which aren't right for you.
Things that would take a toll on you,
emotionally, or physically, or mentally
That makes you put things against you, above you

And yet, **we do it.** Willingly, excitedly,
with a smile, eagerly, passionately

Why?

```
sab ko mil jaegi manzil, ye zaruri to nahi
zindagi raah-e-safar hai yun hi chalte rehna
tum chiragon ki tarah raah me jalte rehna
har andhere ko ujalon me badalte rehna
```
