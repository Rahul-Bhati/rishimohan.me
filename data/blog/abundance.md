excerpt: Have so much of love in yourself so you can give the world more of what you love

![Abundance - Rishi in Zanshe Shans](/images/posts/abundance.jpg)

**What is the most important things in life?**

It would be different for everyone.
Some would say money, some would say love, family, peace, and what not

I believe the basis of everything in this world is love.
Love for money, love for receiving love, love for giving love,
love for peace. Without love, life would be hopeless.
It's love for something that gets you up excitingly

But you know what?

**No love in this world can be permanent. Except one. And that's self-love**

And the good news is, all forms of love comes from self-love

You can lose everything in life. Still, get up,
work hard, and climb the steps of stairs to be at wherever you want.
And all of that happens because you love yourself

I think there's nothing you want to and can't do
if you love yourself enough

And that's why it's important to love yourself. So much,
in abundance that no matter what happens in your life,
your love for yourself makes you so confident that
you know even if you fall, you'll smile because
there's so much love in you for yourself that
you can get back up stronger

This has been on my mind for some time now,
and no matter what happens, it makes me feel better,
stronger, and more importantly, happy

It's like a light inside you
that your body protects from the outside world

And so no matter what happens in the world,
the light inside you still shines.
And only if you're bright enough,
you can make the whole world shine

Love yourself, in _abundance_
