![In Dino - Rishi Mohan](/images/posts/in-dino.jpg)

Sipping on hot water in the morning, it's 11:09 am in Berlin.
Cloudy outside, better. I like it when it gets windy and rainy,
I sit right at the window to feel the cold breeze

I woke up today with random thoughts from the past.
It was all unstrcutured until it started making sense
when I started going deep in the thoughts

It's crazy how some people have **this entitlement**.
They would throw stones on other's home,
or throw garbage in their garden,
and still expect those homes to treat them nicely

And the classic "you were not this before" when
those homes start doing the same. I don't know
where this entitlement comes from

Anyways, I've been working day and night on [Orshot](https://orshot.com).
It's more than just a SaaS, it's something I want to build
to help people do wonderful things with

I haven't been out of home much, figuring out bunch of things
simultaneously. Somehow this phase of my life took me **out
of my comfort zone** and I'm liking it

I remember laughing, giggling too. Yesterday,
I **laughed so hard** for 5 minutes or more on one of the stupid
things while talking with my school friends. The worst part
it wasn't even funny, I just kept laughing and so hard
my eyes were watery and I couldn't breathe

So yeah, life's content both work-wise and personally

Thinking of doing a small trip to a city nearby, maybe Dresden.
I haven't been there, heard it's pretty

I am excited about what's coming

This phase is that part where you've been in the tunnel
for long and you have a feeling you're **about to see the lights**
