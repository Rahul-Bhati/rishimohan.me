excerpt: A simple hack and always-on way to filter blue light in macOS using colour profiles(not using night shift or an app)
---

Being someone who spends 8+ hours a day on screen,
I was looking for a way to make screen light on macOS
warmer since blue-light was getting too much for my eyes

There's Night shift feature in macOS which does this,
but for some reason it never worked consistently for me

So I found a new way to do this using screen calibration
in Colour Profiles in macOS. So go to **Settings â†’ Displays**.
In **Colour profile** dropdown,
click on **Customise**

And then you just **add a new profile**. In the step where
it asks for **White point**, just drag the slider to left
as per your liking and it'll make your display warmer.
This will be always on and active(which is what I wanted)

That's it! Save the profile and select it and save some eye fatigue
