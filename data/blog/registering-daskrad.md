Last week, I registered my first business [DaSkrad](https://daskrad.com) based in London

Here's a [link to Companies House page for DaSkrad](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/16328476)

This was important to keep running and
scale my SaaS products, accept payments and
do things in a more forwal way now

This also means **I signed up for a whooping 19% corporate tax** ðŸ˜…,
which for an indie-hacker is a bit too much.
**But whatever it takes**

It also feels special because **it's my first company**.
And this whole phase feels like leveling up
