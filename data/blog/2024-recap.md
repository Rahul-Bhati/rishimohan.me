![2024 Recap - Rishi Mohan](/images/posts/rishi-antalya.jpg)

This year, I did many things for the first time.
I tried my best to balance work, life, and the things I enjoy.
And honestly, I'm pretty happy with how 2024 turned out for me from the start

## Highlights of 2024

- 🍅 Attended **Tomorrowland** and **Tomatina**
- 🕺 **Danced more** and enjoyed more
- ✈️ **Traveled well**, Antalya, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Valencia, and more
- ✍️ **Wrote more**, whether it was journaling or blog posts
- 🥰 **Made new friends** and lost some
- 😋 Experienced many **first-time things**
- ❇️ **+40% revenue** and **+33% MRR growth** on Pika
- 🚀 Started working on **a new SaaS** last month
- 🧑‍💻 Decided to **part ways with Borg**
- 🏇 **Started working towards a new goal** with a 3 years time limit
- 🤟 Worked hard and lived hard

**This year, I felt free, very much so**. And I like what I'm turning into

I have good friends, a supportive family,
a network that motivates me, and dreams that wake me up.
I'm very grateful for all of it

## Plans for 2025

- Build and grow [Orshot](https://orshot.com) along with Pika
- Focus on health and compounding good habits
- Make more, smarter investments
- Cook more and learn new delicacies
- Learn and experiment with marketing and SEO
- Do more of what makes me afraid
- Live more, think less

This year, I learned that of all the relationships,
your relationship with yourself is the most important

> > To be your best in anything in life,
> > you have to be mentally fulfilled, calm, and at peace.
> > That's when you make the best decisions

It also made me realize that family, partners, friends are add-ons,
you are naturally alone(_!lonely_) with your goals. Some people's presence
will amplify your being to do greater good, some will distract you,
some will pull/push you onto a track that's not for you

Attachment to anything or anyone other than your goals is
nothing but a distraction. And so, a certain level of detachment is important

That was it. It has been an incredible year,
and I know 2025 will be an adventure too

**Happy new year!** wish you all the best for 2025!
