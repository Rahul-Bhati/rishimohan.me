excerpt: About how magical some songs are, so much you don't want to share them with anyone, unless you're lucky

I love indie-songs.
I love how they have emotions
coming out of voice and through
lyrics more than from the instruments.
Some are so magical, they make you live the lyrics.
**Maybe just for a moment**, but yeah

I recently found a really good one,
and I'm listening to it right now.
I listened to it multiple times last night actually.
Not on repeat, mixed with some songs of similar emotions and pace,
and just enough to not make me feel less excited
when I listen to it next

There are songs which you like to share with your friends,
your family

And then there are **songs with so much magic**,
you don't want to share with anyone.
Probably because **such songs reveal something about you**,
your being, your desires, your state, emotions...

**You are lucky if** you have that one person
you can share these magical songs with

And if not, you keep listening to that song

And I guess that's how that **song makes a
stamp on that particular time**.
And when you look back, you recognize the time
by that song. And you relive all the emotions,
situations from that time

> _Magical, isn't it?_

**Who do you share this magic with?**

```
tera sahara, jaise kashti ko kinara
tere hone se, ho piya mera guzara

laut aa ghar...
piya tera kandha mera sir
maangta umar...
piya tera kandha mera sir
```
