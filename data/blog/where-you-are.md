![Where you are - Rishi Mohan](/images/posts/where-you-are.jpg)

_Where's home?_ Yes, it's where you are

You're home for memories that randomly make you smile.
You're home for all the adventures you've taken,
for all the mischiefs you've done

Home for all the nights you've cried,
and the mornings you woke up stronger

You might feel like you don't belong
to the world around you right now

But guess what?

You're not meant to belong to the world,
or the people around you.
You just need to belong to yourself first,
and be your own true self

Home. It's in you, **it's where you are**

```
Zindagi se yahi gila hai mujhe
Tu bohat derr se mila hai mujhe..

Hum safar chahiye hujoom nahi
Ik musafir bhi qafila hai mujhe

Tu mohabbat se koi chaal to chal
Haar jaane ka hoslaa hai mujhe..

Kya khabar maine chahaton mey Faraz..
Kya ganwaaya hai kya mila hai mujhe!!
```
