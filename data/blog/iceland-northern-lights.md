excerpt: There were these waves of green northern lights in the sky, almost flowing like waves do at the shore
---

I was at the [Xata](https://xata.io) offsite in Iceland and we came back from a day
long trip to Þingvellir National Park, Geysir Hot Spring area,
Gullfoss waterfall and Langjökull Glacier

It was around 00:30ish in the night.
There was Slack message on my phone from [Ahmet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmet-gedemenli-78170b199/).
He @channel-ed that the northern lights are out there,
followed by some photos by [Yannis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yannispeyret/)

I was working on [DaSkrad](https://daskrad.com), checked the message
and instantly got up to open my room's door

It wasn't as green as we see in most pictures,
but it was visibly green and beautiful

It was rainy and cloud the whole day,
and I had flight back to Berlin early next morning.
So I didn't have any expectations of seeing
the lights, but dang!

Guess this is what they call _being lucky_ :)

This was the first time I saw the northern lights
