Been pondering over how there's cost of delay

To put into perspective, what was the year you went independent?
And what if that happened late, or early?
How the timeline of your life would change?
I think that would've been significant

**A practical example**, if you invest $1,000 right now every year
for 5 years vs if you started it 5 years back.
The cost of delay is the money you LOST in profits by not investing early

For a long time I've saved liquid in my saving accounts,
letting corpus sit idle and to be safe from risks that come with
aggresive investments

But recently, I've changed that. In last one or so month,
I've invested about 15% of my savings into MFs and
Index funds(inspired by [@levelsio](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1775560709780230539))

**What's the cost of not exploring the world, or exploring it late?**
As someone who loves travelling, I can definitely say you
delay knowing more about yourself and
unlocking the parts of you you didn't know existed

**The cost of finding love late?** You lose exploring the side of you
that gives unconditionally. To care for someone more than yourself.
To know how beautiful is the joy of giving

**The cost of experiencing a breakup late?**
You delay understanding yourself better,
to know what matters to you and what doesn't

**The cost of living late?**
When you delay living your life at your fullest,
you care about what others think, or say.
You pretend, or do things that you don't feel like

This blog is a reminder to you, yes YOU.
To start exploring, doing things as early in your life as can.
You'll learn, fall, grow early and
be closer to what you were meant to do

```
Know that there's a cost of delaying things.
Don't be afraid to do things early.
You'll either make a museum of failure or a gallery of trying.
And both are beautiful
```
