Yesterday, [Pika](https://pika.style) crossed $1,00,000 in total revenue

It doesn't seem that big of a feat
in a world where you see millions of $$ of funding
and people going from zero to six figures in just months

Well, it is a big feat for me. Why?

- I did it solo. Yes, single handedly from 0 to 5 zeros and a 1
- I did it with a full-time job
- I did it every single week since I launched Pika
- I had chances to sell it, offers ranging from $20k to $40k, I chose not to
- I did it along with other interests, like travelling. Makes it difficult to focus
- I did it tired, I did it broke, I did it happy

It **took me close to 3 years** to do cross this mark

Even though I started Pika to solve my own problem
and never intended to grow it as a business,
now **it's much bigger than that initial goal**

> Pika is a space where I test my limits.
> The limits to which I can grow a business,
> to solve a problem, to understand the customers,
> to do marketing, to design a good product,
> to craft the fastest and obvious experience

This year, I'm working on revamping Pika integrating
all the customer requested features

I'll do my best to make sure Pika's the best tool in the space
