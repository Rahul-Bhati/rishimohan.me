excerpt: Why some things are better left unsaid

![Postcards - Rishi Mohan](/images/posts/postcards.jpg)

I have at least 10 postcards on my desk.
I got these from different parts of Europe,
from wherever I travelled. All empty,
ready to be written

I know the address. Once when I was in Mallorca some months back,
I was buying the postcards and the lady at the counter
asked which country I want to send those postcards to.
She asked to also give me country specific stamps
so I can post the postcars to that country.
Guess which country slipped out of my mouth?

I know what to write.
I know the words because they linger in my mind,
late at night. I know the address,
the country, the city, the block, the door number,
person's name

But I won't send it :)

These postcards sit on my desk,
they remind me of why some things are better left unsaid

```
 hone the jitne khel, muqqadar ke ho gye
 hum tuti naav leke, samundar ke ho gye
